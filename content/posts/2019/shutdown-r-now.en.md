Note: First than everything, sorry the english, is not my native language and always learning new stuff about it.

I have always been thinking about writing a blog, but my mindset has always been the same "me? a blog? what am I supposed to post! I can't even think anything I could share with people, I don't know nothing compared to the people
who blogs!", currently that mindset has been changing. In the same way, maybe I read a really entry-level article and at some moment and it was (or is) helpful for me, it also could be helpful for another person as well things faced, the issues I ran into, etc..., and being some sort of way of escape for me itself, I think this change of mindset is the result of my last 9 months living abroad.

I consider I started into IT being really old; with 18 I got my first Linux Sysadmin Job while with 9-12 years some children were playing with code, trying to break stuff, etc.
So far in this aprox. 5 years, I meet really nice people (as also not), and make really really nice friends, and of course been learning quite a lot of stuff, but...there is something that since I started I been avoiding (Programming), and something I've been looking forward to learning it but thinking I can't do it (Security), these two things have been chasing me for a longg longg time (at the point of making me feel a bit depressed).

As I mentioned above, it's been around 9 months since I moved abroad (arrived in the Netherlands at ends of Apr. 2019), of this 9 months I spend 6 months in bench, without a project to work it (yes, getting my salary, but being anxious as I'm, makes you to feel some panic when you get a paid for not doing nothing, even if you are studying), in this months I had a lot of time to think about myself, my career, what I wanted to do in the future, do I like to be a DevOps "for all my life" (today is devops, tomorrow who knows being as how IT works, so is just for saying it in a way), so...I started to study/practice with the book 'How to Design Programs' (HtDP), even feeling I'm going slow looking backwards and comparing to now, I think even if I still haven't finished, it indeed has been allowing me to grow.
Now...great, but, what about security? Is still there, and I really would like to start doing stuff NOW (I'm more a learn-by-doing person), and not wait until get all my way through a designing programs book, combined with my thoughts of "I can't do Sec. without coding/I can't even imagine being breaking stuff without deep understanding of data-types, algorithms", I was getting nowhere, so I decided to try to re-program that mindset of mine, that results in me exchanging words with friends about it, talking with people who are currently into sec, and so far was an excellent idea...thanks to that now I know coding is not needed (as in mandatory) but it helps a lot to at least being able to write scripts, understand the workflow of exploits and modify them, like other things, and...that's something I CAN DO (and have to experience in it). 

Said that now my goal is to jump into the Sec. field, I started to play with boxes in HTB and reading some books, this has allowed me to set my first checkpoint: getting the OSCP cert, not for the cert itself, but more for the challenge and some compensation-ish for not having experience into sec.
Once getting the OSCP, I will come back to the HtDP to polish my programming skills (or why not, also try to keep it in parallel?), and keep climbing (I love rock climbing/bouldering, so I could use a lot of metaphors from it!) my way up to the tops, trying to not compare me with other people, enjoying the route, and learning from all my falls; a fight between me and me.

I will use this space to post walk-throughs in some HTB boxes, blog some thoughts once in a while (like this post itself), stuff in my path of also learning Dutch, etc.

So far so good, keep learning and never stop doing it.
